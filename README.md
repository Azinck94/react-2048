## Project Description

![demo](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DimwittedWeirdIsopod-size_restricted.gif)

  In this project, I made a clone of the Game 2048 with a few modifications. I worked
on this project because I recently learned React. The only way to get better
with a new tool was create things with that tool. I realized that 2048 Game is the perfect
application for React. I got to practice with passing down data and methods in
components. Learned how to use functional and rendering components.
I added a developer twist to this project with Slack Emojis. I got to practice
CSS animation, data maniuplation, and object orientated progamming here too!
I am very proud of this project. Please try it out [here](https://kailinc.github.io/react-2048/).

## Wireframes

  In the beginning, I just drew a rough idea of how I wanted the application to
be. I did not focus on the design aspect of the application at all. I just wanted
an idea of how I wanted the application to look like. I used most of my brain power
on making the features of the application work. Once the application work, I focused
on the design.

## User Stories

  1. As a user, I want to be able to see my score, so I know how I am doing.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to restart a game, so I can keep playing.
  3. As a user, I want to see cool animations, so I can have a great experience.
  4. As a user, I want to see an appealing website, so I can have a great experience.
  5. As a user, I want the board to render according to my arrow keys, so the game is working.
  6. As a user I want to see my current and highscore because I am competitive.
  7. As a user I want to click on links under History, so I can go back in time and correct my mistakes.
  8. As a user I want a congratulatory message when I win, so I feel good about myself and a sense of accomplishment.
  9. As a user I want a loser message when I lose, so I know I messed up.

## Development

  I wanted to work on this project every week day in the semester. However, this semester
is the most intense semester at Boston University. I want to commit at least
5 times each day. I would write psuedo code in class when the professors are
wasting my time. Once I get the time to hack the project, I would use the pseudo
code.

  Initially, I made the game with no animations. It was functional programming.
It was easy to test and I finished it very quickly. The only hard part was
the algorithm for manipulating the data structure to check for matches. I would
write psuedo code and whiteboard any problems I faced. The code for this can be
found in the branch `no-animations`. Once, I finished this and wanted to add animations
to the project, things got gross.

  I had to track information like position, new position, value about each Block.
This would require me to fundamentally change my code. A lot of people were saying
that [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a great tool to be used with state management.
I learned it and thought it was gross. I didn't use it in this project because
I thought it didn't help in this application. I will revisit [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) later because
a lot of people from big companies are praising it.

  I used object orientated programming in this project. Theres an object for game and
blocks. I would pass these objects to React Components. OOP was a very interesting and
intuitive way to do things. However, testing it was not as easy as functional programming.
I would reuse code in `no-animations` branch. The process was enjoyable. I faced a
road block in css animations and positioning because I had 0 experience in it. I
am used to this and comfortable about it. I had to learn [CSS Animations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp). Making things move
was just magical.
