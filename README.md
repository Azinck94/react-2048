## Project Description

In this project, I made a clone of the Game 2048 with a few modifications. I worked
on this project because I just recently learned React. The only way to get better
at React was to work with React. 2048 Game is the perfect application for React.
I got to practice with passing down data and methods in components. Learned how to
use functional and rendering components. I added a developer twist to this project
with Slack Emojis. I got to practice CSS animation, data maniuplation, and
object orientated progamming here too!
