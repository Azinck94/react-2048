## Project Description

I wanted to practice my skills in using React. I thought the best way to practice
React would be to built 2048 Game with React. This would allow me to practice
passing data and practice invoking methods from parent components. So far working
on this project got me very comfortable with React. I want to incorporate
animation library specifically animation.css into this project. I also want to use
giphy API too. It would be funny to have a crazy gip appear if a user gets 2048
or messes up.
