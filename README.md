## Project Description

  In this project, I made a clone of the Game 2048 with a few modifications. I worked
on this project because I just recently learned React. The only way to get better
at React was create things with React. I realized that 2048 Game is the perfect
application for React. I got to practice with passing down data and methods in
components. Learned how to use functional and rendering components.
I added a developer twist to this project with Slack Emojis. I got to practice
CSS animation, data maniuplation, and object orientated progamming here too!
I am very proud of this project. Please try it out [here](https://kailinc.github.io/react-2048/).

## Wireframes

  In the beginning, I just drew a rough idea of how I wanted the application to
be. I did not focus on the design aspect of the application at all. I just wanted
an idea of how I wanted the application to look like. I used most of my brain power
on making the features of the application work.


## Project Demo

  The idea is that each time, a user makes a new high block a slackEmoji will march
the board. I pulled these slack Emojis online. I thought it was a great fun, geeky
touch to the project. Honestly, I think this made the application better than the
original.

## User Stories

  1. As a user, I want to be able to see my score, so I know how I am doing.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to restart a game, so I can keep playing.
  3. As a user, I want to see cool animations, so I can have a great experience.
  4. As a user, I want to see an appealing website, so I can have a great experience.
  5. As a user, I want the board to render according to my arrow keys, so the game is working.
  6. As a user I want to see my current and highscore because I am competitive.
  7. As a user I want to click on links under History, so I can go back in time and correct my mistakes.
  8. As a user I want a congratulatory message when I win, so I feel good about myself and a sense of accomplishment.
  9. As a user I want a loser message when I lose, so I know I messed up.

## Development

  I wanted to work on this project every week day in the semester. However, this semester
is the most intense semester at Boston University. I want to commit at least
5 times each day. I would write psuedo code in class when the professors are
wasting my time. Once I get the time to hack the project, I would use the pseudo
code.

  Initially, I made the game with no animations. It was functional programming.
It was easy to test and I finished it very quickly. The only hard part was
the algorithm for manipulating the data structure to check for matches. I would
write psuedo code and whiteboard any problems I faced. The code for this can be
found in the branch `no-animations`. Once, I finished this and wanted to add animations
to the project, things got gross.

  I had to track information like position, new position, value about each Block.
This would require me to fundamentally change my code.


## Problem Solving Strategy

- coming soon
- sneak peek
- (a lot of whiteboarding, psuedo code, referencing github repositories that have similiar issues that i have, mdn js docs)

## Unsolved Problems

coming soon

## Solution to Unsolved Problems

coming soon

## Takeaways

1. Understand how to use React Components, props, states, and methods.

## Future Tasks
