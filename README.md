## Project Description

I wanted to practice my skills in using React. I thought the best way to practice
React would be to build 2048 Game with React. This would allow me to practice
passing data and practice invoking methods from parent components.

So far working on this project got me very comfortable with React. I undestand
the relationship of Components, Methods, and functions. I am very comfortable
with state, props, and passing down functions to be called on an event.

I want to incorporate animation library specifically animate.css into this project. I hope that it can be easily intergrated with React.
I also want to use giphy API too. It would be funny to have a crazy gip appear
if a user gets 2048 or messes up. Plus it would let me practice using React with
an API. I also want to practice my styling in React. I would probably write raw
css or react-bootstrap. It would be cool to have the theme of the website completely
change when a user completes a higher square in the game.
